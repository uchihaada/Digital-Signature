# Digital Signature
 Signing message with private key and verifying it with public key using python
 
Transactions or any kind of data that is sent over a network is vulnarable in front of attack if it doesnt get encrypted.
so the following methods are used to secure the process.

RSA algorithm is used to generate private key and public key.
SHA256 algorithm is used to encrypt the transaction
The transactions are digitaly signed using private key.
Encrypted data, public key and digital signature is sent to the miner to verify the transaction before mining 


Ide like Spyder can be used to run the python file.
